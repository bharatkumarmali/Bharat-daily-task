    <h2><q><b>Nakki Lake</b></q></h2>
    <blockquote>
        The first man-made lake of India, Nakki Lake has several legends related to it. As per the first legend, the
        lake was built by Gods to protect themselves from their enemy, Bashkali demon. The second legend is based on the
        love story of the sage Rakshiya Balam. <mark> There was a king who ordered that whoever dug a lake with his
            nails
            overnight, would marry his daughter. Rakshiya Balam, who liked the king's daughter, completed the task and
            dug
            the lake with his nails.</mark> Thus, the name is Nakki Lake since Nakh means nails. It was also said that
        Rakshiya
        Balam and his lover were the incarnations of Lord Shiva and Parvati. However, the sage was betrayed and was not
        allowed to marry his lover even after he completed the impossible act.

        <h3><i><q>Nakki Lake, Mount Abu Overview</q></i></h3>
        Situated in the Aravalli ranges in Mount Abu, Nakki Lake, locally known as the Nakki Jheel is a paradise for
        nature lovers. Flanked by amazing natural wonders, this lake is truly a gem of Mount Abu. It is the first
        man-made lake in India with a depth of around 11,000 metres and a width of a quarter of a mile. Located in the
        centre of the hill station, the fascinating lake is surrounded by lush greenery, mountains and strangely shaped
        rocks. As you sail through the serene waters of Nakki Lake, it is exciting to see the life of Mount Abu
        unfolding in front of you. It is a perfect destination for nature lovers and photography fiends.

        In the Nakki Lake, which is associated with many legends, Mahatma Gandhi's ashes were immersed on 12 February
        1948 and Gandhi Ghat was constructed nearby. The attraction is also considered as the love lake of Mount Abu
        since the clean blue waters with verdant surroundings give a romantic feel. It is also said to be the sacred
        lake for the proud Garacia Tribe. The nearby natural wonders that are visible from Nakki Lake increases its
        charm. There is the famous Toad Rock on a hill nearby which looks like a toad about to jump in the lake. By the
        side of Nakki Lake is a path leading to Sunset Point.

    <h2><q><b>Dilwara Temple</b></q></h2>


    <blockquote>
        The five Dilwara Temples are among the most famous Jain temples. The Vimal Vasahi is much the earliest,
        constructed by 1031, with the Luna Vasahi by 1230, and the others at intervals between 1459 and 1582. All are in
        a very white marble that adds greatly to their effect, and remain in use. The oldest and largest two have large
        amounts of intricate carving even by the standards of the style, reaching a peak in the Luna Vasahi temple. The
        main buildings of the first three named are surrounded by "cloister" screens of devakulikā shrines, and are
        fairly plain on the outer walls of these; in the case of the Vimal Vasahi this screen was a later addition,
        around the time of the second temple. These three have an axis from the sanctuary through a closed, then an open
        mandapa to an open rangamandapa, or larger hall for dance or drama.[6] Surrounding the main temple with a
        curtain of shrines was to become a distinctive feature of the Jain temples of West India, still employed in some
        modern temples.[7]

        In later temples in the Māru-Gurjara style, a very pure white marble like that at Dilwara came to be regarded as
        highly desirable, even essential. In modern times, when the style has become popular in other regions of India,
        and with Hindu and Jain communities in other countries, local Rajastani marble is often carved and transported
        to the new building.

        The temples have an opulent entranceway, the simplicity in architecture reflecting Jain values like honesty and
        frugality.[8] The ornamental detail spreading over the minutely carved ceilings, doorways, pillars, and panels
        is considered to be remarkable.[9] It is said that workmen were paid in gold according to the weight of marble
        powder scraped off.[10]
