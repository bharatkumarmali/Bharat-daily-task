    <h2><q><b>City Palace</b></q></h2>
    <blockquote>
        City Palace, Udaipur is a palace complex situated in the city of Udaipur in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It
        was built over a period of nearly 400 years, with contributions from several rulers of the Mewar dynasty. Its
        construction began in 1553, started by Maharana Udai Singh II of the Sisodia Rajput family as he shifted his
        capital from the erstwhile Chittor to the newfound city of Udaipur.[1] The palace is located on the east bank of
        Lake Pichola and has several palaces built within its complex.[2][3][4][5][6]

        The City Palace in Udaipur was built in a flamboyant style and is considered the largest of its type in the
        state of Rajasthan. It was built atop a hill, in a fusion of the Rajasthani Rajput architecture providing a
        panoramic view of the city and its surroundings. Overlooking Lake Pichola, several historic monuments like the
        Lake Palace, Jag Mandir, Jagdish Temple, Monsoon Palace, and Neemach Mata temple, are all in the vicinity of the
        palace complex. Nestled within the Aravali mountain range, these landmarks are associated in popular culture
        with the filming of the 1983 James Bond movie Octopussy.

        <h3><i><q>History</q></i></h3>
        The City Palace was built concurrently with the establishment of the Udaipur city by Maharana Udai Singh II and
        his successor Maharanas over a period of the next 400 years. The Maharanas lived and administered their kingdom
        from this palace, thereby making the palace complex an important historic landmark.[7][8]

        The Mewar kingdom was flourished initially in Nagda (30 kilometres (19 mi) to the north of Udaipur), established
        in 568 AD by Guhil, the first Maharana of Mewar. In the 8th century, the capital was moved to Chittor, a hilltop
        fort from where the Sisodias ruled for 800 years. Maharana Udai Singh II inherited the Mewar kingdom at Chittor
        in 1537 but by that time there were signs of losing control of the fort in wars with the Mughals. Udai Singh II,
        therefore, chose the site near Lake Pichola for his new kingdom as the location was well protected on all sides
        by forests, lakes and the Aravalli hills. He had chosen this site for his new capital, much before the sacking
        of Chittor by Emperor Akbar, on the advice of a hermit he had met during one of his hunting expeditions.

        The earliest royal structure he built here was the Royal courtyard or 'Rai Angan',[9][10][11] which was the
        beginning of the building of the City Palace complex. The court was built at the location where the hermit had
        advised Maharana to build his new capital.[8][9][10][11][12]

        After Udai Singh's death in 1572, his son Maharana Pratap took the reins of power at Udaipur. Later, in the
        famous Battle of Haldighati, which end on stalemate against the Mughal Emperor Akbar in the year 1576. After the
        death of Maharana Pratap, Amar Singh I took the reins of power at Udaipur.

    <h2><q><b>Fateh Sagar Lake</b></q></h2>
    <blockquote>
        Fateh Sagar Lake is situated in the city of Udaipur in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It is an artificial lake
        named after Maharana Fateh Singh of Udaipur and Mewar, constructed north-west of Udaipur, to the north of Lake
        Pichola in the 1680s.

        It is one of the four lakes of the Udaipur city; the other three being: the Lake Pichola (within the Udaipur
        town), Udai Sagar Lake, 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) to the east of Udaipur, and Dhebar Lake or Jaisamand Lake, 52 km
        (32 mi) south east of Udaipur.[1][2]

        Within the confines of the Fatah Sagar Lake, there are three small islands; the largest of these is the Nehru
        Park (4 km2 (1.5 sq mi) area), which is a popular tourist attraction, the second island (0.06 km2 or 15 acres
        area) houses a public park with an impressive water-jet fountain, and the third island (1.2 km2 area) is the
        address for the Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO). The Nehru park is accessible by inboard motor boats. The blue
        waters of the lake and the backdrop of the green mountains has given the soubriquet "the second Kashmir" to
        Udaipur .[1]

        Udaipur Lake Conservation Society's reports indicate that the lake supports and sustains ground water recharge,
        drinking water, agricultural use, industrial use, ecological water availability and provides employment to 60%
        population of Udaipur. [3]

        <h3><i><q>History</q></i></h3>
        The runoff emerging from surrounding hills drains into this lake. The lake is pear-shaped and is encircled by
        the Aravalli hills on three sides with a straight gravity stone masonry dam on the eastern side which has a
        spillway to discharge flood flows during the monsoon season.[4]

        Three causeways, one from Pichola Lake, the other from Madar Lake and the third one from Badi Lake lead to the
        Fateh Sagar Lake. There are three inlet channels, which feed the lake and an overflow section on the eastern
        side in the masonry dam of 800 metres (2,600 ft) length. Monsoon rains are the main source of all water to the
        lake. Initially constructed as an irrigation scheme, it is now the second major source of drinking water to the
        city of Udaipur and the irrigation supplies have been discontinued. A canal from the Rang Sagar Lake connects to
        the Fateh Sagar Lake. A gate controlled canal further connects Fateh Sagar Lake with Lake Pichhola.[5] The
        Northeastern embankment is known by three names viz., the Pal, the Drive, or Connaught Bund (bund means
        embankment).
