    <h2><q><b>Chittor Fort</b></q></h2>
    <blockquote>
        The Chittorgarh (literally Chittor Fort), also known as Chittod Fort, is one of the largest forts in India. It
        is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The fort was the capital of Mewar and is located in the present-day city of
        Chittorgarh. It sprawls over a hill 180 m (590.6 ft) in height spread over an area of 280 ha (691.9 acres) above
        the plains of the valley drained by the Berach River. The fort covers 65 historic structures, which include four
        palaces, 19 large temples, 20 large water bodies, 4 memorials and a few victory towers.

        In 2013, at the 37th session of the World Heritage Committee held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Chittorgarh Fort,
        along with five other forts of Rajasthan, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as a group called the Hill
        Forts of Rajasthan.

        <h3><i><q>History</q></i></h3>
        Chittorgarh (garh means fort) was originally called Chitrakut.[9] It is said to have been built by a local Mori
        Rajput ruler Chitrangada Mori.[10] According to one legend, the name of the fort is derived from its builder.[9]
        Several small Buddhist stupas dated to 9th century based on the script were found at the edge of Jaimal Patta
        lake.[11][12]


        The Guhila ruler Bappa Rawal is said to have captured the fort in either 728 CE or 734 CE. One account states
        that he received the fort in dowry.[9] According to other versions of the legend, Bappa Rawal captured the fort
        either from the mlechchhas or the Moris.[13] Historian R. C. Majumdar theorizes that the Moris were ruling at
        Chittor when the Arabs (mlechchhas) invaded north-western India around 725 CE.[13] The Arabs defeated the Moris,
        and in turn, were defeated by a confederacy that included Bappa Rawal. R. V. Somani theorized that Bappa Rawal
        was a part of the army of Nagabhata I.[14] Some historians doubt the historicity of this legend, arguing that
        the Guhilas did not control Chittor before the reign of the later ruler Allata.[15] The earliest Guhila
        inscription discovered at Chittor is from the reign of Tejasimha (mid-13th century); it mentions
        "Chitrakuta-maha-durga" (the great fort of Chittor).[16]

    <h2><q><b>Vijaya Stambha</b></q></h2>
    <blockquote>
        The Vijaya Stambha is an imposing victory monument located within Chittor Fort in Chittorgarh, Rajasthan,
        India. The tower was constructed by the Hindu Rajput king Rana Kumbha of Mewar in 1448 to commemorate his
        victory over the army of Malwa led by Mahmud Khalji in the Battle of Sarangpur. The tower is dedicated to
        Hindu God Vishnu.[1][2]

        <h3><i><q>Inscriptions</q></i></h3>
        The inscribed slabs in the uppermost storey containing a detailed genealogy of the rulers of Chittaur and
        their deeds is ascribed to Rana Kumbha court scholar, Atri and his son Mahesh. The names of the architect,
        Sutradhar Jaita and his three sons who assisted him, Napa, Puja, and Poma, are carved on the fifth floor of
        the tower.[1]

        The Vijaya Stambha is a remarkable example of religious pluralism practised by the Rajputs. The topmost
        story features an image of the Jain Goddess, Padmavati.[3][4]
