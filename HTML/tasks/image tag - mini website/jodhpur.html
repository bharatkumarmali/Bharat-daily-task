    <h2><q><b>Mehrangarh</b></q></h2>
    <blockquote>
        Mehrangarh Fort covers an area of 1,200 acres (486 hectares) in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. The complex is
        located on a hilltop around 122 metres above the surrounding plain,[1] and was constructed c.â€‰1459 by Rajput
        ruler Rao Jodha, though most of the existing structure is from the 17th century. Inside its boundaries there are
        several palaces known for their intricate carvings and expansive courtyards, as well as a museum housing various
        relics. A winding road leads to and from the city below. The imprints of the impact of cannonballs fired by
        attacking armies of Jaipur can still be seen on the second gate. At the north-east of the fort is the chhatri of
        Kirat Singh Soda, a soldier who fell on the spot defending Mehrangarh.

        There are seven gates, which include Jai Pol (meaning 'victory gate'), built by Maharaja Man Singh to
        commemorate his victories over the Jaipur and Bikaner armies in 1806. The Fattehpol (also meaning 'victory
        gate'), commemorates victory of Maharaja Ajit Singh over the Mughals.

        <h3><i><q>History</q></i></h3>
        Rao Jodha, the chief of the Rathore clan, is credited with the origin of Jodhpur in India.[2] He founded Jodhpur
        in 1459 as the capital of Marwar (Mandore was the previous capital). He was one of Ranmal's 24 sons and became
        the fifteenth Rathore ruler. One year after his accession to the throne, Jodha decided to move his capital to
        the safer location of Jodhpur, as the one thousand years old Mandore fort was no longer considered to provide
        sufficient security. With the trusted aid of Rao Nara (son of Rao Samra), the Mewar forces were subdued at
        Mandore. With that, Rao Jodha gave Rao Nara the title of Diwan. With the help of Rao Nara, the foundation of the
        fort was decided on 12 May 1459[3] by Jodha on a rocky hill 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) to the south of Mandore. This
        hill was known as Bhakurcheeria, the mountain of birds. According to legend to build the fort he had to displace
        the hill's sole human occupant, a hermit called Cheeria Nathji, the lord of birds. Cheeria Nathji was a man with
        the local population as his followers and hence influential in the region. When requested to move he refused
        categorically. This happened many times. Rao Jodha then took extreme measures and sought help from another more
        powerful saint, Karni Mata of Deshnoke who was a hindu warrior sage born in Charan caste. At the request of the
        king, she came and asked Cheeria Nathji to quit immediately. Seeing a superior power he left at once but cursed
        Rao Jodha with words "Jodha! May your citadel ever suffer a scarcity of water!". Rao Jodha managed to appease
        the hermit by building a house and a temple in the fort. Karni Mata laid down the foundation stone of the
        Mehrangarh Fort. Today only the forts of Bikaner and Jodhpur remain in the hands of Rathores, both had their
        foundation stones laid by Shri Karni Mata. All other Rajput forts of Rajasthan were abandoned for some or the
        other reasons by the respective clans. Only the Rathores of Jodhpur and Bikaner have their forts with them till
        date. This fact is considered a miracle by the local population and is attributed to Shri Karni Mata. Rao Jodha
        also granted villages of Mathania and Chopasni to the two Charan warlords who were sent by him to request maa
        Mehaai to come to Jodhpur.[4]

        To ensure that the new site proved propitious; he buried a man of the Meghwal caste called "Raja Ram Meghwal",
        who offered his services voluntarily, alive in the foundations as this was considered auspicious those days.
        "Raja Ram Meghwal" was promised that in return his family would be looked after by the Rathores. His family was
        granted land and to this day his descendants still live in Raj Bag, near Soor Sagar.

    <h2><q><b>Umaid Bhawan Palace</b></q></h2>
    <blockquote>
        Umaid Bhawan Palace, located in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India, is one of the world's largest private residences. A
        part of the palace is managed by Taj Hotels. It is named after Maharaja Umaid Singh, grandfather of the present
        owner, Gaj Singh. The palace has 347 rooms and is the principal residence of the former Jodhpur royal family. A
        part of the palace is a museum.

        The groundbreaking for the foundations of the building was carried out on 18 November 1929 by Maharaja Umaid
        Singh and the construction work was completed in 1943.

        <h3><i><q>History</q></i></h3>
        The history of building the Umaid Bhawan Palace is linked to a curse by a saint who had said that a period of
        drought would follow the good rule of the Rathore Dynasty. Thus, after the end of the about 50-year reign of
        Pratap Singh, Jodhpur faced severe drought and famine in the 1920s for a period of three consecutive years. The
        farmers of the area, faced with this hardship, sought the help of the then Maharaja, Umaid Singh,[1] who was the
        37th Rathore ruler of Marwar at Jodhpur,[2] to provide them with some employment so that they could survive the
        harsh conditions. The Maharaja, in order to help the farmers, decided to build a lavish palace. He commissioned
        Henry Vaughan Lanchester as the architect to prepare the plans for the palace; Lanchester was a contemporary of
        Edwin Lutyens, who had planned the buildings of the New Delhi government complex. Lanchester patterned the Umaid
        Palace on the lines of the New Delhi building complex by adopting the theme of domes and columns.[1] The palace
        was designed as a blend of western technology and Indian architectural features.[2]

        The palace was built at a slow pace as its initial objective was to provide employment to the famine-stricken
        farmers in the area. The foundation stone was laid in 1929. About 2,000 to 3,000 people were employed in its
        construction.[3] Occupation of the palace by the Maharaja came after its completion in 1943, and close to the
        period of Indian Independence. There was some criticism for embarking on an expensive project but it had served
        the main purpose of helping the citizens of Jodhpur to face the famine situation.[1] The estimated cost of
        building the palace was Rs 11 million.[4] When it opened in 1943 it was considered one of the largest royal
        residences in the world.[2]
